These are flowcharts for proposed workflows for the SSEDAS project.

The source files are *.graphml, generated with the cross-platform yEd editor.

another place to find stuff about SSEDAS is the TransforMap ownCloud in /TransforMap/Projects/SSEDAS/ (ask for access if you are a TransforMap contributor)
